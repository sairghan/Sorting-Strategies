# Sorting-Strategies

This is one of the projects of my Algorithm Design (INFSCI 2591) course at School of Information Sciences (iSchool), University of Pittsburgh. This project examines several sorting algorithms and evaluate them when executed in a real-time scenario.

Any questions regarding the source code, idea, implementation etc. can be routed to me.
